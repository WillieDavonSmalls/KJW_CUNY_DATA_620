Google Ads,1,Vanita Thompson,Vanita Thompson,"Google Ads provides analytic reporting on how people use a website. Google Analytics tracks what people do after clicking an ad. It traces and provides information on how people found a particular website, and how the website was explored.  Using the information, a website owner can identify trends and generate ideas to enhance their website. For example, you can learn how much time is spent on a site, what items were browsed, and what items were placed in the cart. Those factors can provide leads on enhancing customers' experience, which in turn can help increase conversions like sales and return on ad spend."
Google Ads,2,Zachary Alexander,Vanita Thompson,"Hi Vanita -- I definitely agree that Google Ads provides a really good platform for analytical reporting and marketing. I used to work pretty closely with Google's suite of marketing tools and think they are really advanced in their ability to measure advertisement/marketing reach, as well as user and website activity! Google Analytics has continued to a leader on this front, and I'm curious to see if we talk much about this in our course!"
Marketing Analytics in Healthcare,1,Vijaya Cherukuri,Vijaya Cherukuri,"Marketing Analytics in Healthcare is used for Inbound and Outbound Marketing Metrics. This will help them in Building a Plan, Track results.

The business of healthcare is ruled by numbers – revenue, reimbursement and patient volumes .

These are some main KPI which will help them in driving the business.

1) Assist patients and families in navigating health care so they can make more informed decisions and access the care they need and deserve.

2) Grow referrals and admissions across the system.

3) Leverage cost efficiencies to increase ROI.

4) Increase qualified calls to the contact center."
Marketing Analytics in Healthcare,2,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Vijaya Cherukuri,"Right. Data Analytics in the healthcare industry is changing the way patients and doctors handle care. The more data analytics involved, the more efficient healthcare can be."
Marketing Analytics in Healthcare,2,Murat Akyildirim,Vijaya Cherukuri,"With the expected increase in Virtual Care, I am curious what other KPI metrics will be added to an organization in terms of marketing analytics. Some of the metrics that comes into my mind

- time spend on session

- importance of web property metrics (acquisition , engagement and etc...) 

- purchase funnel analysis (drop offs and etc...) "
Marketing Analytics in Healthcare,2,Jeremy O'Brien,Vijaya Cherukuri,"If I'm not mistaken, one of the goals of Obamacare was outcome-based payments to healthcare providers.  I'm not clear on where healthcare policy currently stands (it's difficult to keep up with the tumult of the current administration), but if patient outcomes and population health remain part of compensation for healthcare systems then I imagine they should be reflected in some way in marketing analytics."
Online Food Ordering,1,Priya Shaji,Priya Shaji,"Food ordering business has a need to gain a better insight into the life cycles of its customers while gaining the ability to optimize sales reports and marketing campaigns in a time-efficient, cost-saving, and autonomous way.

By gaining self-service access to real-time analytical information the company was able to streamline its marketing and sales activities, make better, swifter decisions based on real-time information.

The use of a real-time dashboard has empowered many budding online food giant to monitor all significant business operations through customized KPIs.  With the help of sales, graphs and charts the data is easily interacted with, and presented on a single screen.

Therefore marketing analytics demonstrates how quickly the power of business intelligence affects the decision-making processes and creates a backbone for sustainable growth."
Online Food Ordering,2,Ken Popkin,Priya Shaji,"Good choice for this topic, Priya.  I used to work for a company called Gordon Food Service (GFS).  We distributed food to restaurants and one of our objectives was to get our customers to use more online tools, including analytics.  The online food ordering places like you mention are very open to analytics, but a lot of the older food establishments (Mom & Pop type restaurants) tend to be reluctant.

It will be interesting to see with all the recent changes due to Covid if the Mom & Pop type restaurants that I just mentioned can survive if they remain resistant to using analytics.  "
Online Food Ordering,2,Priya Shaji,Ken Popkin,"Yes, that's a good point Ken. Familiarity with online tools and analytics will be pretty useful for restaurants and shops during covid. "
Cambridge Analytica,1,Mikhail Kollontai,Mikhail Kollontai,"The Cambridge Analytica scandal is one of the most visible recent cases of data analytics being used for nefarious purposes. This British firm exploited the lack of robust privacy internet laws to collect personal information on millions of users (with the support of Facebook).

The goal of this mass data grab was to identify candidates susceptible to political advertising aimed to influence voting patterns. It identified correlations between users' posts, likes, groups, etc.  and their political leanings. By using these correlations it could identify users (or areas where such users could be found) to identify populations who's vote could be won. It then sold this information to various political campaigns, allowing them to aim their focus on people most likely to be swayed by their message. 

In terms of concrete metrics, we need only look at the 2016 election to find the fruits of this labor. Though it did identify the gaping holes in internet privacy laws controlling social media platforms, it also fed a valuable debate on the extent to which data analytics can be used within politics and the morality of this practice. 

"
Cambridge Analytica,2,Elina Azrilyan ,Mikhail Kollontai,Great example of data used for political reasons and you bring up a good point of ethical implications of Data Analytics and issues with privacy.
Cambridge Analytica,2,Sheryl Piechocki,Mikhail Kollontai,"Great example Mikhail.  The analytics used here was able to find very specific target areas that would provide the most bang for their buck.  By focusing the campaign in mainly these areas, the campaign funds were able to be used where they would give the most value."
General Electric,1,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"GE use marketing analytics to track country of origin for their site users. This can provide GE with a rich insight into where market demands are arising and how to better cater their web pages to different languages and cultures. GM also is implementing a site analytics tool across its dealer network. The tool uses Esri ArcGIS technology to combine US Census tract data with demographic-based consumer profiles, available through the ArcGIS platform.

General Electric,2,Jagdish Chhabria,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"That's interesting, Abdellah. Using Census Data long with geo-location tracking seems pretty sophisticated. I'm new to this so not sure if this is common practice by now. But it sounds like it's aimed at giving dealers an insight into the potential customer's demographics and either make targeted marketing efforts or know more about their needs even before when they walk into the dealer's center."
Big Data Packages for Marketing Analytics,1,Ken Popkin,Ken Popkin,"The tech companies we most often hear about like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have had large in-house teams of data analysts and data scientists for a number of years.  Now that word is out on the success these companies have had many other companies are striving to achieve similar results.  The article at this link shares success stories that a number of companies have had using big data marketing analytics packages.  Here's a few examples...

1. A large coffee company partnered with a marketing analytics company called 4C to target audiences via the use of emojis.  The result was more than 800,000 impressions on Twitter and a 260% jump in engagement.

2. The Boston Globe partnered with Blueconic's customer data platform and by applying their metrics & reports experienced results of a more engaged audience, more subscribers, and more advertising revenue.

In total the above link covers 20 big data companies and the impact their tools & reports have had on a number of companies (some of whom are household names)."
Big Data Packages for Marketing Analytics,2,Priya Shaji,Ken Popkin,Example of coffee company reaching thousands of people by use of emojis and analytics is a good example for this topic!
Big Data Packages for Marketing Analytics,2,Mikhail Kollontai,Ken Popkin,"I'd love to see what the 800,000 impressions and 260% jump in engagement equates to in terms of sales numbers!"
Big Data Packages for Marketing Analytics,2,Steven Ellingson,Mikhail Kollontai,"Agreed on that.  Marketing folks like to talk about impressions, etc. but I want to know about the sales.  How would you go about measuring that?  You could look for an increase in sales over time, but how can you say for sure the marketing is causing the increase?"
Big Data Packages for Marketing Analytics,2,Mikhail Kollontai,Steven Ellingson,"I think that's a fascinating side of marketing - you can never truly be sure what aspect of a marketing campaign (if any) is the cause of a rise in sales. One way would be to offer certain offers alongside the ""emoji"" marketing efforts - this would at least create a clear subset of sales that were directly cause byt he marketing ploy. "
Heap and Casper,1,Jit Seneviratne,Jit Seneviratne,"This post is how an product analytics firm (Heap)  helped the mattress firm Casper revamp their analytics and improve conversion rates. I’m citing this article: https://heap.io/customer-stories/casper

Casper Marketing Analytics:

Prior to Heap, Casper had been focused on increasing customer volume. Once their sales numbers became huge, revenue became very sensitive to changes in marketing and services, and they needed help on marketing decisions. Heap helped them understand much more than sales. Heap helped them understand customer behavior. 

One way Heap achieved this was conducting A/B testing on the visibility of different offerings (such as courier delivery). Heap found that customers engage with the shipping information on Casper’s web interface to a high degree, and that the vast majority of customers use courier delivery. Casper changed their web page indicate availability of the courier option earlier in the checkout process and watched for improvements in conversion rates. 

While the article does not indicate how the A/B test was be carried out, a z-test of on the difference in proportions / conversion rates (pre and post initiative) is an example. The result of all this is that Heap helped Casper increase checkout conversion by 20%.

Heap also helped create more robust infrastructure by consolidating their ETL pipeline into one place using Amazon Redshift.

"

Food Delivery in Sports Stadiums,1,Mael Illien,Mael Illien,"A friend of mine is developing a mobile app designed to improve food service in sports venues. The idea is that you shouldn't miss parts of sports event you paid for while waiting in line for a beverage. The app connects you to a food vendor who will dispatch someone to bring your purchase to your seat.

The marketing goals are clearly to expand to all kinds of sports and venues and analytic measures can help to facilitate that. Some performance metrics beyond the obvious number of times the app was downloaded include: frequency of use by the same user, number of recommendations to other users (via share links), @ or # mentions on social media platforms. With limited initial capital, the company can use analytics like the ones just described can help focus the development path by responding to these metrics and expanding accordingly."
Food Delivery in Sports Stadiums,2,Amber Ferger,Mael Illien,"This is a really interesting idea for an app! I think one of the most understated marketing strategies is providing a share link. I've seen this become an ever more present component of so many companies. By allowing a user to share their link and receive some sort of incentive, the company reaches a larger customer base for a smaller amount of money!"
Marketing Analytics - Case Study from Digital Marketing Experience,1,Zachary Alexander,Zachary Alexander,"I used to work for a digital marketing company that worked closely with brands to help push their marketing reach on digital platforms. One company I worked with in particular was a small clothing/retail company that was trying to increase their brand awareness and customer base.

In our initial meetings with company stakeholders, we first thought through and determined their current client base, and identified the types of customers that buy their clothing. We then set up marketing goals to target these individuals on online platforms. We purposely didn't create too much of a strategy over the first few months, in order to gather data and information on those that were navigating their website and digital platforms. By setting up events on certain components of their website (i.e. buttons/pages), we then could track user activity throughout their site. We also set up a robust marketing campaign to expand their reach on search engines and social media platforms like Google, Facebook, etc. Once we were able to pull in a fair amount of data, we looked at things like ""click-through-rate"" (how many times people search and then click on an advertisement for the brand), as well as time spent on website pages and product pages. We also looked how people landed on their website, was it through social media platforms? Directly searching on search engines? We then became more specific with our targeting, and did our best to funnel users on their website to ""convert"" on certain products. For instance, based on user activity, if someone had items in their shopping cart but didn't click the ""buy"" button, we could then use a ""re-marketing"" campaign to show ads to this individual on other sites and social media to remind them that they had these items in their cart. Over time, we could then track the success of these campaigns and tweak the strategy based on which practices seemed to be most effective. KPIs such as click-through-rate, impressions, and page rank were important for digital ads, and then events on the website such as button clicks, shopping cart items, etc. were important indicators as well.

Full disclosure, I only worked at this company for 10 months because I felt like the technology was becoming too creepy, but for brands and companies trying to expand their reach and sales, these tactics proved to be very effective."
Marketing Analytics - Case Study from Digital Marketing Experience,2,Murat Akyildirim,Zachary Alexander,It sounds like we work in a similar field. I think Marketing Analytics created (specially in the digital area) new business models. For example ; there are companies out there with sole purpose to become major referrals for certain products. (Example: Compare credit cards and sign up) They create web properties to become referral to organizations and further partner with them with certain annual service fees. 
Marketing Analytics - Case Study from Digital Marketing Experience,2,Sheryl Piechocki,Zachary Alexander,"Thanks for that example Zachary!

Most people don't understand how much they are being tracked through their on-line activity.  It definitely works for these companies to use this data to increase sales."
Marketing Analytics - Case Study from Digital Marketing Experience,2,Jeremy O'Brien,Zachary Alexander,"Interesting case study, Zachary.  Sounds like your client was using a mix of first party tracking (finding people who their own websites at a recent point in the past) and third party tracking (social media platforms or non-owned-and-operated web properties). 

Those who find online targeting creepy may be relieved to hear that Google (which has majority browser share in the US) will be deprecating third-party cookies for use in retargeting, attribution, and other digital marketing techniques come 2022.  Marketers will still be able to remarket to visitors of their own sites, but data brokers that hoover up credit histories or model lookalikes based on browsing behavior will have an almost impossible time selling 'segments' for programmatic advertising.

Google is still working with the world-wide web consortium (W3C) and ad tech community to align on what use cases and technologies it will support following the removal of third-party cookies, but for those interested a number of approaches are being discussed here."
Data Analytics in Marketing Strategies,1,Elina Azrilyan ,Elina Azrilyan ,"There are a variety of ways in which Marketing can benefit from such Data Analytics tools as network analysis and text mining. I will discuss just a few of them. Personalizing customer interactions can be very beneficial for establishing a relationship with a customer and increasing profits. Network Analysis and Text Mining can help determine what preferences and needs your customer has. Key performance indicators for this could be the percentage of return customers and website clicks and sales based on marketing communications. Marketing can also benefit from monitoring the reputation their product has on social media as it has a become a significant customer research tool. Key performance indicators for this could be profits as a function of positive social media presence.

Marketing Analytics for Insurance company,1,Subhalaxmi Rout,Subhalaxmi Rout,"Insurance is an industry that is heavily dependent on the accuracy of predicting risk. The correct assessment of risk determines the policy premium that’s payable by the insured, upon which the insurer’s losses or gains are dependent. Insurance helps to protect the customer from a potential loss, and to predict the likelihood of that loss, or claim, occurring.

With the help of analytics, an insurance company can reach to potential customers. Identifying, attracting, and retaining high-quality policyholders is a challenge that insurers across the industry face. To solve this, insurers must amass and utilize highly predictive, insurance-specific intelligence while prospecting. 

KPI for potential customers:

Source of Traffic – Identify the sources from where users come to the insurer’s website, for example – from google or banner ads.

Unique Page Visits – How many new visitors are coming each month, this gives an idea of how many visitors keep coming back for more, and how many new visitors are landing?

Social Media Engagement – Are consumers liking, commenting, and sharing the insurer's social media posts?

Bounce Rate – This metric measures the percentage of visitors to the insurer's website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.

Conversion Rates – This metric measures the percentage of people who take the desired action, such as fill out a lead generation form to download an offer from insurers.

Lending,1,Steven Ellingson,Steven Ellingson,"My company helps to service loans.  We use google analytics to help track how someone ended up on our website and to try to give attribution for a new or returning customer.


These things are always challenging, as marketing often won't directly lead to a sale, but it could keep the brand in mind for a later date.


I personally like split testing whenever possible.  Instead of just tracking after the fact, give different groups different treatments and see how they perform. This obviously isn't always feasible, I don't believe you can split test something like Google Adwords, and so tracking attribution is important in those cases."

Marketing team has a certain budget they need to allocate within certain marketing channels. Their objective is to ensure the marketing budget is distributed to get the most consumer acquisition and conversion. High level KPI’s defined for the marketing team are User Acquisition, Engagement with marketing Assets and Conversion. Below are some examples;

For Content and Brand Web Properties:

Landing WebPage Acquisition (Top Landing Pages that users land on)

Campaign, offer sales, monthly revenue (if the product is subscription based).
Sentiment Analysis

Market Research (twitter, amazon reviews and etc..) to help with marketing creative and offers.
Social Media or Reviews Acquisition to the organization property and shopper and order conversion.
Analyzing Relationship between Marketing Assets

Consumer Journey between online and offline marketing assets
How do the organization acquire (which marketing assets) the consumers most?
How do they convert (consumer purchase -which marketing assets) the consumer most?
Relationship between online and offline marketing campaigns and assets.
Based on my experience, the challenging part is to compare and analyze web property collected data, offline data and data collected and stored via various platforms in organization’s database. There are always discrepancies between the platforms and the idea is to ensure the variance between them is acceptable. I have recently started leveraging external Platform APIs(GA, Adobe)  and internal databases in order to collect user web property engagement data. My goal is to bring the analysis on an individual level which seems difficult but with certain assumptions I believe it is possible.

If there are any suggestions around a workflow for collecting online data and creating data pipelines (merging them in cloud - Bigquery etc... ) for automated analysis, please share."
Cross Selling,1,Sheryl Piechocki,Sheryl Piechocki,"I work at a major health insurance company.  While our main product is medical insurance, we also offer dental, vision, and life insurance products.

One major marketing goal is to increase cross selling to existing customers.  The goal is to get existing medical customers to also buy another product we offer, whether that be dental, vision, or life (or all 3).  We also have customers that just have our dental or vision or life product and we would like to entice them to also purchase our medical insurance product.  Campaigns are created to offer customers discounts for bundling products.  Existing customer data is analyzed to decipher which types of customers are more likely to have multiple products.  Customer profiles are created.  Then customers with only one product are compared to the customer profiles to determine what additional products should be marketed to them.

The campaign measures used are:

Percentage of customers with only one insurance product
Percentage of customers with more than one insurance product
Looking at these measures over time, we can see if cross selling is increasing and which campaigns are successful"
Cross Selling,2,Jit Seneviratne,Sheryl Piechocki,"This reminds me of recommender systems, where we can recommend products to customers based on purchases by other customers with similar buying patterns. Cosine similarity is one approach which comes to mind. Another is alternating least squares (ALS)."
Amazon & Recommendation Systems,1,Amber Ferger,Amber Ferger,"We all know Amazon - the online retail giant that allows users to purchase anything they can think of with the click of a button. Amazon distinguishes itself from other retailers with its customer-centric model that relies on a digital marketing strategy. 

The company's sales outline a highly successful marketing strategy -- In 2019, Amazon reported $87.4 billion in revenue and in quarter 1 of 2020, they reported $75.5 billion. Their success lies in the fact that users keep coming back. The average prime member spends $1400 per year on Amazon purchases versus non-prime at $600 (Statistica source). What's even more impressive is their ad revenue -- Amazon boasts an average revenue of $15 per user from advertising. (Source)

These numbers are a result of a simple goal: make customers happy. According to John Dudovskiy, Amazon's marketing strategy is composed of four essential elements: (1) offer a large variety of products, (2) provide a user-friendly gui, (3) scale rapidly and seamlessly, and (4) market new products. (Source) This strategy is made possible in large part because of the trove of data they possess -- every page view, every purchase, and every product review is recorded and tracked. Data is aggregated and analyzed to uncover market trends, identify successful (and unsuccessful) products, and understand consumer preferences. From a consumer standpoint, this digital feedback can improve user experience by providing more accurate recommendations. Some metrics on the consumer side include: frequency of purchases, average product review, average spending, and number of repeat purchases. From a logistical standpoint, the data can be used to identify bottlenecks and improve operational metrics. Metrics on the logistical side include: delivery time, purchases per product, warehouse costs, delivery costs, and packaging time.

It really is a win-win situation. Amazon profits from your data, and you end up a happy customer with products delivered in a quick and efficient manner. 

"
Amazon & Recommendation Systems,2,Mael Illien,Amber Ferger,"The wealth of data Amazon can access is enormous. Between product ratings, comments, ratings on comments, there are so many ways to translate customer behavior into metrics. I'd be curious to know how their advertising strategy differs based on customer profiles like for example a heavy shopper vs a visitor who does not make purchases often. Overall it's clear the system is a very efficient and a success as they have plenty of data to train on!"
Amazon & Recommendation Systems,2,Subhalaxmi Rout,Amber Ferger,"Interesting post Amber, on Amazon’s recommendation system. This helps Amazon as well as customers to reach their goals. For each product Amazon provides “What other items do customers buy after viewing this item” – This is based on market basket analysis which products that are bought together. Achieving customer loyalty and repeat purchases has been key to Amazon’s success. To achieve this Amazon added some features such as Lower Priced Items to Consider, Compare with similar items, Customer questions & answers, customer reviews, and customer images. This way customers build more trust in Amazon."
Amazon & Recommendation Systems,2,Jack Russo,Amber Ferger,"Tying this into NLP CH 1. 

Amzon has access to vast amounts of data about not just what people are buying/reviewing but how people are buying and reviewing. For example how certain reviewers use different words in the products is as important what to recommend as number of stars in the review."
Uber,1,Jeremy O'Brien,Jeremy O'Brien,"Thought Uber could be an interesting example (and one I know a little about from a previous role).  Uber seeks to strike a balance between supply and demand for the services (ride shares, scooter shares, food delivery, etc.) it offers in each metropolitan area in which the company operates.  It competes with companies like Lyft and Postmates.

Key for Uber to strike that balance is to acquire an install base of drivers and delivery people that provide services and ride requests and food orders making use of those services.  With a balanced base, at any given time Uber's yield and promotional algorithms can adjust pricing to 1) attract enough drivers or discourage excess drivers in order to meet current demand, or 2) attract users from competitors or substitutes (i.e. public transportation) to utilize current supply.

As an app, Uber’s install base, monthly and daily active users are key to business success.  From a marketing standpoint, these translate to KPIs like new installs by local market and ride / order volume by market.  Not all riders, drivers, and food orderers are created equal, and attracting potential new users who use more services – or more valuable services – is important to Uber reaching profitability.  Metrics like estimated lifetime value of new users are important to ensuring that marketing tactics are correctly targeted and cost-efficient.  And building brand preference (over competitors and substitutes) improves the elasticity of all the preceding metrics, acting as a force multiplier for the KPIs above."
Marketing analytics in public sector,1,Habib Khan,Habib Khan,"Hello,

I have been working with New York City as a data analyst. Like all profit organizations, government sector has also some defined objective which is to serve public. As a public servant, our aim is to provide the public the most of our services depending on the department. In Department of Citywide Administrative Services, one of our objectives is to conduct on-time civil service exams and to engage especially minorities living in NYC. For that we get the data in terms of reviews, could be from facebook, etc. Most of times, general public don't know about the openings in public sector and thus most of the hirings are done within City employees. The marketing goals could be to spread the information about civil service exams and openings. I belive we can use web analytics in this perspective and try to find out which communities are not involved in city hirings and thus change strategies accordingly. As we will proceed further and we will learn more techniques, I will be more sure about the practical applications of marketing analytics in public sector.

Thanks,

Habib Khan"
Social network media platforms,1,Simon Ustoyev,Simon Ustoyev,"Not surprisingly,  by now, a lot of companies, from tech giants down to startups, are looking to capitalize on offering  data analytics as a service or a platform.  In this article from Springer (https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-business-accounts-analytics/), back in July 2014, the section, ""Social network media platforms"" gives a good glimpse of the companies and their services which allow other commercial companies have the power of network analysis and text mining in driving forward their marketing and business goals.  Among notable platforms that handle sentiment and semantic analysis of Web include Google Analytics, HP Autonomy IDOL (Intelligent Data Operating Layer), IBM SPSS Modeler, Adobe SocialAnalytics and many others.  Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg are incorporating Twitter sentiment analysis and visualizations into trading platforms for financial companies.

One company which caught my attention is iSpot.tv,  ""…which launched its own social media analytics platform that matches television ads with mentions on Twitter and Facebook. It provides real-time reports about when and where an ad appears, together with what people are saying about it on social networks (iSpot.tv monitors almost 80 different networks).""

It is not difficult to imagine a use case where the marketing department of a company can adjust or target where it wants to air more TV ads, by combining the sentiment of people's reactions to the ads with network analysis of  people's demographics."
Social network media platforms,2,Mia Chen,Simon Ustoyev,"This reminds me of the time I worked with data management platforms (Salesforce, Amobee and Adobe Audience Manager) where we created segmentations based on audience demographics and frequency caps. By comparing the engagement rates and sales attributions among different segmentations, we could better understand where and whom the media dollars should be spending towards when we plan the next campaign."
Social network media platforms,2,Willie Smalls,Simon Ustoyev,Wow.  iSpot.tv sounds like it will increase the efficacy of organizations ad spend. 
Harlem Coffee Company,1,Willie Smalls,Willie Smalls,"Harlem Coffee Company is a local, independent, and third wave coffee company started in Harlem, NYC with the slogan deep, rich, smoothe.  The organization’s intent is to tap into Harlem’s growing upwardly mobile and socially conscious clientele.  It is strategically positioned next to the 116th 2 and 3 train stop to take advantage of foot traffic.  

 

The company uses much of its marketing spend to increase foot traffic into the coffee shop and grow customer loyalty.  For key performance indicators, Harlem Coffee company focuses on revenue growth, customer turnover, new customer growth, spend per customer, staff turnover, and expense reduction. 

 

To grow its digital footprint and increase local, national, and international exposure, the organization forced its WiFi users to follow them on Instagram and it also partnered with Yelp for SEO (search engine optimization).  Harlem is a favorite amongst European visitors.  Harlem Coffee Company paid significant attention to its follower based growth, engagement of users, and re-grams.  Owners indicated that as its digital footprint grew, so did its customer base.  

 

Harlem Coffee Company used loyalty cards to track retention, customer loyalty, average monthly revenue per user, spending, and other customer habits, e.g., items purchase, time of day visits, etc.  

 

Because Harlem Coffee Company prides itself on being a triple bottom line organization, the organization focused a lot on reinvesting back into the community by supporting other local organizations, such as donating hot chocolate to the Marcus Garvey Christmas party in Harlem and hosting open mic night.  The organization would always track sales seven days after an event to see if there was an uptick.  One of the more profitable initiatives was it’s support of local artists, which often drew a significant amount of number customers.   "
Harlem Coffee Company,2,Jagdish Chhabria,Willie Smalls,"It's interesting that even single channel businesses like Harlem Coffee Company are so media-savvy and using different tools to market their products. Based on what you said in your post (single address), my assumption is that this is not a chain of coffee stores, but a single outlet (Mom & Pop shop?). If that is indeed true, then it's commendable that they are so marketing savvy."
Harlem Coffee Company,2,Willie Smalls,Jagdish Chhabria,"Yes, it is a single shop.  The owner is a pretty brilliant guy.  His dream was to open a restaurant and his mentors told him to first start at a coffee shop.  He studied a lot of marketing in college.  "
Mercedes social media campaign,1,Jagdish Chhabria,Jagdish Chhabria,"Mercedes is a world-class brand with tremendous recognition. However, I suspect that perhaps the brand awareness and following is likely higher amongst older adults with a higher income, and not as much amongst the younger generations that are starting their careers. It seems back in 2013, Mercedes wanted to increase its brand awareness amongst the younger audience so it ran this very successful campaign on Instagram. It hired five top Instagram photographers to each take the wheel of a new Mercedes CLA. Whoever got the most likes got to keep the car – so they all really worked at it!  By the end of the campaign, Mercedes had received:

87,000,000 organic Instagram impressions
2,000,000 Instagram likes
150 new marketing assets (stunning photos)

In general, the main KPIs for social media marketing seem to be:

1) Impressions (or Reach): Number of unique visitors to social media property.

2) Engagement: Amount of time spent on social media property and actions such as liking or sharing or forwarding.

3) Leads or Clicks: Number of clicks resulting in generation of leads.

4) Sentiment: Whether positive or negative and intensity of sentiment.

5) Share of voice: Proportion of customer engagement for a group of competing brands."
Campaign Performance Reporting,1,Mia Chen,Mia Chen,"My team at UM (a media agency) analyzes digital and social data to report and make recommendations to help clients achieve their marketing goals. Some of the KPIs we use to measure the campaigns are CTR (click through rate), CPC (cost per click), VCR (video completion rate), Reach and Frequency, CPLPV (cost per landing page view), LPVR (landing page view rate) and etc. KPIs varied by funnels and campaigns - awareness campaigns' primary KPIs are impressions and views, while consideration campaigns' KPIs are more about cost efficiencies and engagement rates. By comparing the KPI performances between different target audiences, ads, and platforms, we can understand which audience is resonating with which ad, then make optimizations to shift more budgets toward well-performing groups while limiting spend towards under-performing ones. "
Campaign Performance Reporting,2,Simon Ustoyev,Mia Chen,That's pretty cool and it looks like that you'll directly benefit from this course. I think that network analysis and text mining will greatly add value in addition to the KPIs that you already use.
Personal Experience - Politics,1,Jack Russo,Jack Russo,"I once worked for an organization that measured how likely voters were to vote in an election when targeted with an add about an issue they cared about, or I should say were predicted to care about. We used predictive modeling to extrapolate data we had (likes flyfishing and school vouchers) to voter for which we only had one piece of the puzzle (likes flyfishing). I can only speculate but access to voter's SN data may have been a more direct way to measure which voters cared about what. "
Personal Experience - Politics,2,Habib Khan,Jack Russo,I am still not sure how else we can use these techniques in different sectors. Thanks for sharing your aspect.
"Going back to 3,000 BC",1,Ken Popkin,Ken Popkin,"My perspective on technology advances and job loss is that articles like the one for this discussion focus on what skills technology takes over, but don't focus enough on the increased complexity (in other words - increased opportunity) that advances provide.

If I could go back to 3,000 BC, I'd bring along some pictures of all the modern equipment we have for building.  I'm fairly confident that the construction workers (builders of caves and tents) that I'd talk to would be in awe of all the cool equipment --  they'd see one guy driving a bull dozer, another in a huge dump truck fully loaded.  But then I envision some of them getting depressed - concluding that with equipment like this you don't need many people to build a cave - they'd worry that their descendants won't have jobs.

But then I'd show them pictures of skyscrapers, large cities, huge factories.  And explain that there are actually more jobs because as the technology got better, the complexity became greater, and along with it came greater opportunity.

Carrying this analogy forward to AI in 2020, my take is that machine learning, robotic process automation, and application of these and similar technologies is going to continue to increase, not decrease the number of jobs.  To me the question we ask should be, ""how do we keep everyone learning new skills?"", but that is a conversation for another Discussion Topic."
"Going back to 3,000 BC",2,Jack Russo,Ken Popkin,"My take on this depend on how ownership of tech is distributed.  If I own a law firm and am able to cut my workforce due to the acquisition of textual analysis software, that's a benefit to me but not necessarily everyone. Sure it means better, faster, cheaper stuff for those with an income stream but not for the unemployed. "
"Going back to 3,000 BC",2,Mikhail Kollontai,Ken Popkin,"I have largely shared your view but I do find myself wondering. I think your last point hits the nail on the head - getting people to keep up with the growth is what needs to be the focus. The problem here though is that the speed with which technology is evolving. I think the point from Colvin's article that really resonated with me was the fact that Watson was already  240% faster than he had been 2 years previously. Humans can't possibly be expected to learn that quickly (without outside help, CRISPR being a potential avenue here).

With each year the effort required to transition to the new in-demand career increases. I think the concern may be that some newer careers that emerge thanks to this technological revolution will be unattainable by those whose careers are eliminated."
Text Mining Pharmaceutical Data,1,Sheryl Piechocki,Sheryl Piechocki,"Recently, BenevolentAI was able to identify a potential pharmaceutical to aid in the fight against COVID-19.  They combed through a vast digital storehouse of biomedical data to identify drugs already approved for other conditions that correlated with protein targets affected by the SARS-COV-2 virus.  All of this was done in just a few days time.  

This is not a case that will necessarily eliminate jobs, but it allows new discoveries that would not previously have been possible.

Text Mining Pharmaceutical Data,2,Steven Ellingson,Sheryl Piechocki,"Thank you for sharing Sheryl that is very interesting!  I wish I could find out more about the datasets that they are using.  I love the idea of ""drug repurposing"" as it's been so valuable to medicine so far (I/e retrovirus cancer medication used to treat AIDS) and most of the repurposing has been ""accidental"" at best. Using a targeted to try to identify these could lead to a lot of new effective medications that have already been tested and are widely available."
Process automation,1,Priya Shaji,Priya Shaji,"According to a study by Harvard business review on “Artificial Intelligence in real world” : RPA(Robotic Process Automation ) is the least expensive and easiest to implement of the cognitive technologies , and typically brings a quick and high return on investment. 

At NASA, cost pressures led the agency to launch four RPA pilots in accounts payable and receivable, IT spending, and human resources all managed by a shared services center. The four projects worked well in the HR application, for example, 86% of transactions were completed without human intervention and are being rolled out across the organization. NASA is now implementing more RPA bots, some with higher levels of intelligence.


As technology improves, robotic automation projects are likely to lead to some job losses in the future,

Process automation,2,Vijaya Cherukuri,Priya Shaji,"Yes Priya, I agree with you.

RPA can be greatly benefitial but at the same time it might lead to job loss. IT is mainly focussing on RPA process for many shared services for transitions, trainings, call center etc.

There are high chances that AI can change the face of the world in future."
Hiring decisions by companies using text mining,1,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"As technological advances accelerate and compound they might eliminate jobs.  As an example for  over  two  decades  information  retrieval  systems have  been  used  by  human  re-sources (HR) departments and external headhunting services to filter and sort candi-dates based on a set of weighted features gathered from the cover letters and résumés or curriculum vitae (CVs).  HR is now the prime candidate for adoption of NPL-based technology as HR inherently people centric and communication based. These  new retrieval systems combine the tasks of natural language processing (NLP), data and text mining technology will reduce human bias in decision- making application. example include resume scoring and survey analysis. More recently, systems have employed artificial  intelligence  (AI)  to  identify  which  candidates  are  likely  to  accept  the  job offer.

Hiring decisions by companies using text mining,2,Ken Popkin,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"I agree that NLP has great potential for HR departments, but to me they've gone overboard on their dependency on this technology.  I know some great candidates that fall thru the cracks and unfortunately still see some ""not so great"" candidates moved forward in the hiring process."
Hiring decisions by companies using text mining,2,Zachary Alexander,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"Thanks for sharing this! I also wrote a bit about advances in technology and software to support recruitment efforts. I do worry though that there could be too much dependency on NLP and algorithms to sort through resumes and candidates in the future -- although many of these tools have good intentions (i.e. reducing human bias, etc.), there's still a lot of room for unintended consequences to creep into the system. For instance, the engineers developing these technologies could unintentionally be inserting bias in their scoring system or the algorithms they write, or NLP processing on certain words or phrases could limit resumes based on particular languages or skillsets, which in a way could be its own form of bias. It will be interesting to see what the trajectory of this type of technology takes in the future, and if it'll become more of the standard practice for hiring!"
Call Center,1,Steven Ellingson,Steven Ellingson,"More and more, when you're on a website they will be trying to hide their phone number and get you to chat.  Call center jobs have steadily been moving offshore to save costs, and now companies are attempting to replace much of the client interactions with a chatbot.

Currently most of these are only really good at answering simple, common questions.  What is my balance?  When is my next payment due?  But as time goes on the idea will be to answer more and more subtle questions. 

Not only questions, but sales as well. Sales is all about overcoming objections, and describing value. Not only can an AI be trained for this purpose, it can be fine-tuned to the most effective strategies in a way that you could never do with a sales staff."
Call Center,2,Amber Ferger,Steven Ellingson,"This is a really interesting example of AI replacing humans. It seems like more and more companies are choosing to use automated messaging systems to route user calls to the appropriate area within the company, and you're absolutely right that the performance is very limited to a standard set of functions. I imagine that audio calls are typically recorded, converted to text, and analyzed for key topics -- it would make sense that this information is incorporated into the messaging systems to increase comprehension of the machines. However, I can't help but get annoyed whenever I call and hear a bot: they're slower at understanding what I need and often make me go through hoops and hurdles to find out what I really want. I wonder how long it will take for the technology to become less robotic, more humanistic, and ultimately more personable. "
Call Center,2,Vanita Thompson,Steven Ellingson,"I worked in call centers after HS. It is interesting to see how big data technologies are changing the industry. Through use of automated systems, companies have dramatically downsized their staff."
Call Center,2,Willie Smalls,Steven Ellingson,"JetBlack, now defunct, or absorbed into Wall-Mart's Jet used chat bots to act as a concierge service for ""mommagers,"" or upscale NYCers.  So, a user would text say ""Jenny I need a gift for a 5-year old Boy"".  The chat bot replies with 5 options.  The user can approve the option or ask for additional options. The option is delivered to the individuals specified addresse.  "
Call Center,2,Sheryl Piechocki,Steven Ellingson,"My own company has instituted these chat bots on their website.  It pops up to ask if it can help you.  You can then answer yes or say no thanks.  The annoying part is that if you say no, but are still on the website after some period of time, it pops up again with the same question.  I suppose it thinks you must need help since you are still on the same page or haven't done any action.  "
Social Credit,1,Jack Russo,Jack Russo,"The Chinese are developing a system of ""social credit""  which in theory is supposed to measure how good a given citizen someone is but is really just a mechanism of social control. Someone will be able to access a line of credit or get a permit will depend on their scored.   A persons ""social credit"" score depends on who that person is networked with on social media.

Network analysis may enable a handful of people to keep a billion in line."
Social Credit,2,Elina Azrilyan ,Jack Russo,"That is a very interesting, if scary concept - quantifying the ""social value"" of an individual - basically expending the concept of a ""credit score"" beyond Financial implications. "
Social Credit,2,Jeremy O'Brien,Jack Russo,"Here's some more context on inputs for the China's Social Credit System:

China Social Credit System.PNG 

And consequences, which range from internet throttling to school / job / transportation bans to pet confiscation...

It's interesting to compare social credit with financial credit, which in the states has a regulatory framework focus on equity and fairness in algorithmic decisioning (i.e. clarity on what drives ones credit scores)."
Medical Coding,1,Amber Ferger,Amber Ferger,"I work in health insurance and one of the hot topics in this industry (and one that I'm excited to be participating in) is text mining for medical coding. In short, medical coders review a patient's medical chart to identify conditions and record them using standardized code-sets (ex: ICD10, DRG). The work is manual - coders must sift through irrelevant and unusable information to find sufficient evidence in support of a particular condition. Further complicating things, the layout and terminology of the documents varies drastically and code-sets and coding rules are updated yearly, so a standardized, programmatic approach is usually not feasible. The coders rely on their past experience and expertise to evaluate the text and make decisions about the conditions that the patient has. 

While this has traditionally been a profession reserved for licensed professionals (through the American Academy of Professional Coders), the past 10 years or so has seen an increase in the number of vendors providing NLP software to extract the conditions from within the text. These solutions are typically packaged into a user-friendly platform where coders can see the raw text, coding suggestions, and the extracted information overlaid on the medical chart. The coder reviews the findings and either confirms or rejects the suggestions and the feedback is cycled back to the vendor to provide additional training data for the algorithm. 

These types of platforms increase productivity of the coders, but don't currently have the ability to completely replace them. Because the field is so specific (coding guidelines are expansive and medical terminology varies drastically), human expertise often outperforms the machine in final selections. However, the health insurance industry is often lagging when it comes to technology, so more advanced techniques tend not to be applied to the problems that our industry faces as quickly as other industries. 

All this being said, as the insurance industry catches up to the rest of the tech world, software will likely become good enough to outperform our human coders. Computer programs can already recognize key terms and variations more efficiently than a human can. Although text comprehension is traditionally thought to be a humanistic trait, advances in natural language techniques and deep learning will likely enable a machine to interpret free-form text and make decisions in a similar manner.

I think computers will gradually replace tasks of medical coders until the role of the medical coder becomes completely transformed. It will take quite some time for humans to become comfortable with the decision-making from a machine, especially when dollars are tied to the decisions (inaccurate coding can lead to losses of millions of dollars in reimbursement). However, as machines become more ""human-like"" in their decision making, they will start to take over more and more responsibilities of the medical coders until the coders find themselves either out of work or performing tasks that are much different than what they do now. "
Medical Coding,2,Jit Seneviratne,Amber Ferger,"I think you pointed out the key inhibitor of progress in this area: the cost of an error. While machines will outperform humans in mundane tasks, as the complexity of the job rises, the gap will close. Also, even if robots in fact make fewer errors, if the consequences of an error are severe, we'd be very apprehensive to trust a machine with that task. Futher, from a legal perspective, a mistake by a machine can sometimes be a gray area, such as with self driving cars and accidents."
Job Hiring/Recruitment,1,Zachary Alexander,Zachary Alexander,"One example of text mining and/or network analysis that could eventually eliminate jobs is in the field of hiring/recruitment. As text mining capabilities get smarter, and become more apt at scanning text on resumes and application materials, we'll continue to see this type of software utilized more in the hiring process. Allowing AI software to do the ""dirty work"" of sifting through hundreds of resumes to find the right candidate is already being advertised as a cost-effective tool that could trim hours off of a job search process.

Here's a list of ten companies that are already providing this type of asset: https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/buyer-guide/ai-recruiting

As time goes on, and these types of tools become more effective in processing resumes and applications, it may be more lucrative to do away with internal positions that concentrate solely on recruitment. Right now, it seems like this type of software is mostly useful as a tool for recruitment teams, but eventually, it could perform ""better"" than humans in matching an employer to the right candidate."
Job Hiring/Recruitment,2,Subhalaxmi Rout,Zachary Alexander,"I do agree with you, Zach. We are on the same page with this idea. Due to text mining, manual effort reduces, and productivity increases. "
Text Mining in Law Firms,1,Vanita Thompson,Vanita Thompson,"During discovery, lawyers and paralegals must thoroughly examine thousands of documents, or even more depending on the case. Now, databases can use big data text mining techniques including keyword recognition and syntax analysis to accomplish these tasks in a fraction of the time.  In recent years, machine learning systems have been trained to review case history and precedents, and even draft  legal briefs traditionally reserved for junior level associates. In general, lawyers are paid to predict outcomes of major cases. However, statistical models created by researchers have been proven to predict the outcome of nearly 70% of supreme court cases. Prediction is possibly one of the most valuable services lawyers provide, and now it is easily matched by computers."
Text Mining in Law Firms,2,Simon Ustoyev,Vanita Thompson,"I also discussed on this topic.  I could easier imagine jobs lost and demands diminishing for human skills in the judicial process, but harder to imagine what new jobs can be added."
NLP in HR and Recruiting,1,Subhalaxmi Rout,Subhalaxmi Rout,"The future of work is a good article to describe humans and robots work together to get high productivity. Robert is more intelligent and efficient than humans. But the robot doesn't have human intelligence such as understanding feelings. For example, given in the article even though the robot can take better decisions in a case still human is needed to convey the result. People are more relying on a human to listen to the decision.

According to my opinion, the machine is there to help humans. Using machine-human can improve productivity. But the human job is still there. The manual work gets reduce but critical thinking, analytical thinking, and communication for this field of humans are needed. The human need to improve their skill set so that they can best use of the machine.  Because in the future more demand for highly skilled and educated workers.

Example: NLP in HR and Recruiting

Using NLP in human resources, HR professionals can speed up candidate searches by filtering out relevant resumes and designing bias-proof and gender-neutral job descriptions. Also by making the use of semantic analysis, software sifts through the considerable synonyms enabling recruiters to detect candidates that meet the job requirements.

NLP in HR and Recruiting,2,Priya Shaji,Subhalaxmi Rout,"Good example, NLP in HR can also increase their efficiency and probably lessen paper works."
NLP in HR and Recruiting,2,Subhalaxmi Rout,Priya Shaji,"Yes, due to NLP the manual efforts reduced additionally productivity of the recruitment process increases. "
NLP in HR and Recruiting,2,Jagdish Chhabria,Subhalaxmi Rout,"I believe using NLP for filtering resumes is a double-edged sword. As candidates realize that their resumes are being ""crawled"" by automated tools, they start stuffing keywords in their resumes to game the system. So I'm not sure how much of the end result is as per the original intent i.e. that job candidates would create completely honest resumes and a ""smart"" algorithm would weed out the less attractive candidates."
Sentiment Analysis,1,Mael Illien,Mael Illien,"Sentiment Analysis is a very important example of work that was not previously possible and has potential to expand further. Different scales are used to quantify emotions in language, for example positive-neutral-negative or more gradated scales. It is important because it allows us to do what was not possible beforehand, namely to quantify qualitative information from unstructured data (text) beyond tf-idf style analysis.

By putting a number on the sentiment of people towards companies or political issues, we can make some informed decisions. Sentdex (http://sentdex.com/) provides sentiment scores for financial, political and geographical topics. You can imagine how knowing the sentiment or the optimism about a company can influence you to purchase or sell a stock, especially since optimism is an expression of one’s belief of the future, which is a true driver of stock price, whose shifts are largely unidentifiable in corporate earnings reports.

Beyond the financial example, I think there is there room for sentiment analysis to be applied to many fields, especially if in the attempt to improve an AI we try to teach it how, we humans, are feeling beyond explicit phrases like “I am sad”. I also wonder if there are NLP research efforts to try to detect and analyze subtext or unconscious communications, which is something I believe computers do not do well. If they did, even psychology which is exclusively human, could be replaced with robo-therapists."
Human Tech Support,1,Jit Seneviratne,Jit Seneviratne,"Human tech support staff /call centers are declining , and it seems they are becoming casualties of service technology. However, users are become more sophisticated and as a result, their needs are becoming more complex: Many today don't call tech support to have a robot ask them if they 'tried restarting their machines'. With the advent of AI, our problems become more nuanced as well, so while level one support can feasibly be carried out by robots, level two and level three support will see a spike in handing volumes. It will be interesting to see if AI keeps up with that rapid rise in volume."
Human Tech Support,2,Sheryl Piechocki,Jit Seneviratne,"This is definitely the case.  In recent months, more and more websites I visit have a bot window pop-up asking if it can help me after a certain amount of time.  I don't usually ask any questions because I think the bot most likely has answers to only basic questions. "
Property and Workers Compensation Catastrophe Modelling,1,Willie Smalls,Willie Smalls,"Previously, Property and Workers Compensation Catastrophe modeling was a very lucrative career due to the complex nature of peril models and understanding of engineering and science concepts.  Insurance firms historically hired large teams of catastrophe modelers to process schedule of values (list of locations for a policy).  Think of Wal-mart and all of its locations.  Those would be included in a schedule.  For years, high wage workers would translate these schedule of values into a form that is recognizable by the catastrophe model.  As time progressed, insurance firms began offloading those schedules offshore to be processed.  Now, they have been using their large swaths of previously coded SOVs to build algorithms to reduce the human labor footprint.  "
Workplace email analysis,1,Mikhail Kollontai,Mikhail Kollontai,"While the morality of such an endeavor would be questionable, I can imagine a test-mining algorithm being used to analyze workplace email correspondence and identify potential disciplinary problems for HR. One of the biggest obstacles to HR being able to monitor behavior at an office is the fact that they require a party to reach out to them pro-actively before any investigation is performed. I can imagine such an algorithm constantly monitoring email communication within the office and flagging potential problem areas. Network analysis can further be used to cross-reference these areas with expected degree of communication. Network analysis of correspondences can also be used to identify communities within the office and drive both integration efforts and influence team-building initiatives. "
Workplace email analysis,2,Jagdish Chhabria,Mikhail Kollontai,"As far as I know, companies are already using such technology to monitor employee communication. So this is not some futuristic endeavor. Compliance departments in banks already monitor text and voice communications  by traders and investment bankers to ensure that they are not violating securities laws. IT departments as well as HR in large companies already monitor text communication for inappropriate content. As the technology becomes more commoditized, I'd expect smaller firms to be able to afford such monitoring tools as well."
AI in Automotive,1,Vijaya Cherukuri,Vijaya Cherukuri,"AI had already landed its foot on many industries. When we think of AI applications in the automotive industry, we might first think of self-driving cars. Tesla already made a noteworthy achievement in this.

In my opinion, AI will be useful, but it should not overtake or minimize the proiority of humans. With combined efforts of Machines and Humans we can achieve better results. Think of some places where AI scores high, one great example is Parking sensors and Active monitoring of blind spots.

AI in Automotive,2,Mael Illien,Vijaya Cherukuri,"The automotive industry, and particularly trucking is one of the biggest potential victims of automation. This is not like the case of the lawyer example who can now do the work of 500 by leveraging text mining. This has potential to replace all driving, whether for human mobility or the transportation of cargo, across all industries. And it doesn't stop at driving since planes can already land themselves and cargo ships rely on course correction software to reach their destination. 5G will enable even more intra device communication. The conversion of truck drivers into Internet of things engineers is not obvious so it is expected that some jobs will be lost. The classic counterpoint is that of course, jobs will also be created to maintain this new ecosystem of interconnected things. And when things are connected, there's an opportunity to leverage network analysis and graph theory. "
AI in Automotive,2,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Vijaya Cherukuri,i am wondering if we will ever see AI or Machine Learning being used to design F1 cars or NASCAR . Perhaps it’s already happening.
AI in Automotive,2,Murat Akyildirim,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,thats a great question. Here is a brief article on that (   https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/05/18/nascar-safety/ ) .
Medical Diagnosis,1,Elina Azrilyan ,Elina Azrilyan ,"Similar to the example of lawyer skills being replaces with AI tools, the same parallel can be drawn to the medical field. Both fields require many years of training to master each respective skill and the use of text mining and network analysis could simplify these jobs. A tool which had the ability to diagnose a patient based on a wide array of information would save valuable time and resources. It would make diagnosing rare medical conditions easier - and allow human doctor to work with conjunction with such a tool to treat people more effectively. Additionally a tool like that can be useful in early detection of diseases when it is too early for a patient to notice the issue but there might be signs pointing to a diagnosis. Here is an example of a medical tool available for interpreting Radiology labs: https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/digital-health-solutions/digital-solutions-overview/clinical-decision-support/ai-rad-companion#Clinical_Outcomes"
Judge and Jury,1,Simon Ustoyev,Simon Ustoyev,"In trying to imagine what jobs can be eliminated, by the advance of text mining, network analysis and AI in general, I’d like to rephrase the question in the article and instead ask, “What will computers do better than people?”  To answer that question, I’d like to take the narrative of the article about diminishing demand of lawyer skills and take it to the next level and envision the whole judicial system being run by machines and “really” keep that blindfold on the Lady of Justice.  I don’t think it’s a far-fetched idea from realization at this point that machines can be better judges and jury in the near future.  Judges are trained in the rules of pure logic to arrive to decisions and to ensure that the judicial proceedings are conducted fairly, by striking down any “tricks” that may be played by lawyers and/or witnesses to influence a jury.  AI has already progressed impressively in NLP, CV (image/video) processing, as well as in processing visual and biological factors in “reading” humans, in order to arrive at “truth” classification of a testimony better than a polygraph test can.  Network analysis, for example, can be employed in determining how parties in a case are involved, the flow of events and etc.  The appeals and review process can still be performed by qualified humans (when requested), but even that, with time, will diminish.  A human may still, occasionally, win the AI system in rendering proper justice, by perhaps using imagination or following some “hunch” to turn the outcome around, but then only to discover the “short-lived” advantage to be programmed into the next upgrade for the AI Judicial System."
Judge and Jury,2,Willie Smalls,Simon Ustoyev,"When I first saw the subject for the post my heart stop for a second.  I went back to moot court where I noticed above the bench, where the judge sat these words: ""The law must be stable, but it must not stand still."".  It would be slightly difficult to completely turn the judicial system over to AI because the law is ever evolving.  There are ""their rules"" and then there are ""there rules.""  Being a POC, I would love it if lady justice was blind.  Maybe we could have avoided much of what we are seeing today."
Customer Assistants - Analysis,1,Murat Akyildirim,Murat Akyildirim,"Geoff Colvin’s article, “ Future of the Work”, is an interesting read, giving his perception on what skills and career paths would be more valuable with the current technological advancement. Couple examples provided by him are Google self driving cars, self vacuum cleaner and other mobile robots such as iRobot and Baxter robot and the recently popular law analytical services such as Lex Machina and Huron Legal.

The idea behind the article is similar to every phase of the change in the work environment, even though computers can perform certain jobs better than humans (such as skimming through and analyzing, sorting documents , predicting the result of a case in Supreme Court), the jobs don’t disappear and rather the new jobs and opportunities become available with new required skills. As a conclusion, he states the jobs and skills that will be valuable would be the ones that us humans insist to be performed by humans rather than computers.  

As the text mining and network analysis are becoming advanced in terms of technology and applications, in my opinion, jobs that require analysis might get eliminated. For example, automation of business and marketing reports, easy use of platforms for businesses might eliminate Data Analyst positions which would allow business units to work directly with the platforms. Human aspect of analysis such as breaking down business objectives, creating high level problem statement for business solutions and breaking that statement down into incremental problems would become more important than solely providing analysis.

Another possible elimination of skills and work would be due to the voice-enabled cloud connected assistants. For example ipsoft technology (Amelia) is being leveraged in many ways such as Customer Service Agent, IT Operations Expert and even a phycologist (https://www.ipsoft.com/amelia/ ) . These assistants can be used in many ways to provide seamless consumer interactions and transactions. They can be trained to help sell insurance or prequalify people for mortgages which can eliminate mortgage brokers and insurance sales people. However , these assistants don’t build any relationship with the customer or bring any empathy."
Customer Assistants - Analysis,2,Habib Khan,Murat Akyildirim,I agree with you. I think data driven positions have already started eliminated those jobs.
Text mining's potential impacts on publishing,1,Jeremy O'Brien,Jeremy O'Brien,"The publishing world has been debating what impact to expect from text mining.  While it might be far-fetched for to imagine authors replaced in the creative process (particularly for fiction, where generative algorithms haven't broken the blood-brain barrier - meaning - needed to succeed at story-telling), there are many other potential impacts.  For example, machine-based translations of foreign-language texts to aid publishers in deciding whether to option them, preemptively developing promotional campaigns with WIP manuscripts based on their similarity to other, successfully marketed titles, or even creating a much-dreaded feedback loop using sales data and text analytics to inform editing (i.e. encouraging authors to write what sells).

A number of these possibilities are discussed in this thesis paper, which is an interesting if non-technical read."
Network analysis in fraud detection,1,Habib Khan,Habib Khan,"Data driven analysis are being widely used globally for business process reengineering in both profit and non-profit organizations for better optimization. Banking sector is using fraud detection through network analysis and other techniques to identify the potential frauds for better security of the customers and their accuracy is also getting better with the inclusion of big data. I think few jobs might be eliminated with reference to fraud detection but at the same time data analysts would be required. I have found this article quite useful on how text mining is being used in different sectors.

Using text mining to identify contracts that need re-negotiation,1,Jagdish Chhabria,Jagdish Chhabria,"One significant undertaking going on in the financial services sector is the migration of interest rate benchmarks from LIBOR to other Alternate Reference Rates (ARRs). There are literally trillions of dollars of contracts (loans, derivatives etc) that reference the LIBOR rate. As a result of fixing collusion scandals, the Bank of England decided that it would no longer force banks to provide LIBOR quotes after 2021.

As banks rush to replace the benchmark rate in millions of contracts, the use of text mining techniques to scan millions of pages of legal contracts for words such as ""LIBOR"" and the context it is used on and whether there are fall-back provisions is replacing what would traditionally have been done manually by armies of clerks. So this is definitely one example where these techniques are replacing humans and increasing productivity and efficiency."
Frida vs the CEO,1,Mael Illien,Mael Illien,"I found example from The Power of Informal Networks in the readings very interesting, where it was actually Frida and not the CEO that was the central node of the network. This makes me think about the companies I’ve worked for in a similar context where it is often how long a person has served for that determines their centrality.

This article referenced below provides a good explanation of the types of individuals mentioned in the readings such as the connectors, the boundary spanners, the information brokers and the peripheral specialists. All are examples that can be identified using graphs and centrality measures.

In the Frida example, she can be identified as a connector by looking at the degree of edges spanning from her node, which is the maximum in the small office network.

Frida vs the CEO,2,Jack Russo,Mael Illien,"It's quite striking how those ""informal networks"" clash with the formal structure of an organization. Makes you wonder about diseconomies of scale balancing increasing returns to scale. In classical economics an increasing return to scale can mean an infinite quantity is produced.... theoretically. In reality increasing complexity and informal networks cap the feasible scale of any firm."
Frida vs the CEO,2,Steven Ellingson,Mael Illien,"I've found this example to be very accurate in my experience.  There are always people that others come to with their issues, and they are usually not the boss. Whether it's due to experience or just having the right personality, certain colleagues get asked things constantly and are extremely important nodes in their networks."
Frieda's Bow Tie Network,1,Jack Russo,Jack Russo,"Keeping things simple, Frieda Bow-Tie Network at AMCE is an obvious example. You could compute the betweenness centrality for each member of the network and it would likely show you that the veteran secretary controlled the bottleneck. Though this may have been sufficient in that instance to produce a positive outcome, further analysis could have use a ""grey cardinal metric to access the importance of peripheral figures."
Microsoft success,1,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"Paul Revere was an information broker, a person who occupies a key role in a social network by connecting disparate groups of people. Now imagine that the information being transmitted by the messengers is not about redcoats, but about a new product idea or a different way to manage a team. If that information isn’t delivered to the right people, it will wither and die.

For example, before Microsoft was a household name, Bill Gates had a singular distinction in his network—his mother, Mary Gates, who sat on the board of United Way with John Akers, a high-level IBM executive. At the time, Akers was helping to lead IBM into the desktop computer business. Mary Gates talked to Akers about the new breed of small companies in the computer industry, which she felt were underappreciated competitors of the larger firms with which IBM traditionally. partnered. Maybe she changed Akers’s vision of who to go to for the new IBM PC’s DOS, or maybe her comments confirmed what he already knew. In either case, after their conversation, Akers took proposals from small companies, one of which was Microsoft. The rest is history: Microsoft won the DOS contract and eventually eclipsed IBM as the world’s most powerful computer company.

Without Bill Gates’s potent network, a sensational new operating system might have faded into obscurity just like William Dawes.

So  the most important or central person in this network (Centrality measures) is Mary Gates.

Kardashians,1,Vanita Thompson,Vanita Thompson,"Kim Kardashian and The Kardashian family have been effective at hacking/navigating their social networks. They have ammased a tremendous following, and are ranked amongst the most popular public figures on popular social networking apps, such as Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube. Their analysts may use degree centrality (both inward and outward), betweness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality to analyse their social networks. Since degree centrality measures the number of edges on a node, it can be considered a measure of popularity. Betweeness centrality is a measure of a nodes centrality in the network equal to the number of shortest paths from all other verticies to all others that pass through that node, or a node's ability to bridge different subnetworks. Higher betweeness centrality scores may indicate the importance of a node (or Kardashian) in a network. Closeness centrality is a measure of the average shortest distance from each vertex to each other vertex. Direct connections and shortest paths are important. A lower closeness centrality score shows more direct connections (closeness). Eigenvector centrality is a metric that measures the degrees of the nodes that a node is connected to. It can be used to calculate how “connected” are the nodes connected to a Kardashian. It is a way of determine how popular the Kardashian's friends are. Using subgraphs show all the nodes that node is connected to. These centrality measures can be used to predict positive and negative outcomes, such as icreasing social media engagement for marketting opportunities, or filtering bad publicity and comments on their social platforms."
Kardashians,2,Amber Ferger,Vanita Thompson,"This is an example that I wouldn't have thought of! Celebrity social media activity can definitely be used as a proxy for their influence. The larger the following on any account, the wider the audience for their messages. This popularity can be used to engage supporters while promoting themselves (a really smart marketing technique) and advance their personal agendas. Nice job!"
Kardashians,2,Vanita Thompson,Amber Ferger,"Thank  you Amber. I thought this would be an interesting choice. I believe the website Social Blade uses similar centrality measures to rank popularity amongst youtubers. They analyze profits based on traffic generated from video views.

Vanita"
Kardashians,2,Zachary Alexander,Vanita Thompson,"Really enjoyed this example, Vanita -- very interesting how you demonstrated the Kardashian's prowess on social media, and I agree, it would be really interesting to measure degree centrality for many of the close connections to the family to measure the real impact that this family has on other people's networks! I also had an example that highlighted Justin Beiber's online reach, and find celebrity networks to be quite fascinating. Thanks for sharing!"
Cindy Kimberly,1,Zachary Alexander,Zachary Alexander,"In 2016, Justin Beiber posted a photo of Cindy Kimberly on his feed with the caption, ""OMG, who is this!?"". Since then, Cindy Kimberly has become a famous model, and launched her successful career on Instagram, amassing over 6 million followers on the social media site. Based on her connection with Justin Beiber, her betweeness centrality measure with him and many of her new connections allowed her to expand her network, and to interact and engage with new groups of people over a very short period of time. Justin Beiber's degree centrality on Instagram is quite high, and he currently has over 138 million followers, making him one of the biggest influencers on Instagram. With this large of a following, he holds a lot of clout in driving the narrative on the platform. We can see here that Cindy Kimberly had a positive outcome from this interaction, and her talent and savvy has made her as famous as she is today. These two measures seem to be the most relevant for this example. I do think that centrality measures would allow me to predict the relative positive or negative outcomes in this example.

Johannes Gutenberg,1,Mikhail Kollontai,Mikhail Kollontai,"I think one of the original ""hackers"" of the social network was Johannes Gutenberg with his invention of the printing press. His invention was a large step in trivializing the spread of information. Before this invention, each piece of literature was unique and created through hours and hours of manual labor. They were therefore difficult to procure and reserved for higher society and the church. Not only the content, but those exposed to it could therefore be fairly well controlled. 

Gutenberg's invention essentially allowed information to be shared with an entire network without a single point of contact (the owner of a book). It also significantly reduced the cost of creating a piece of literature, allowing those of much lesser means to also share the information they wanted with the world. If this isn't hacking the system, than I don't know what is. "
Johannes Gutenberg,2,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Mikhail Kollontai,Thanks for sharing. Johannes Gutenberg is credited as the inventor of modern mechanical printing but I as know he introduced the printing to Europe Bi Sheng  did in China four centuries earlier. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng.
Johannes Gutenberg,2,Mikhail Kollontai,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"I must say I'm embarrassed not to have heard about this - thank you so much for pointing it out. Just goes to show how much ""Western"" accomplishments are glorified in the education system here! I'll make sure to fix this gap in my knowledge of history."
Russian Twitter Bots,1,Amber Ferger,Amber Ferger,"Although this isn't a specific person, it's a good example of how fast and far fake news can spread. This was a big issue with the last US election, and, not surprisingly, it continues to be an issue with other natural disasters and events (like coronavirus). 

Russia took advantage of twitter's social network to spread false information in the last presidential election, ultimately creating distrust and anger in the American population. The bots' targeted messaging aided in further dividing our political system by curating tweets that attacked Clinton and supported Trump. Due to the inherent connectedness of twitter, these tweets reached a large audience on the platform in a short amount of time.

The hackers were successful because they understood the inherent nature of social behavior - we tend to interact with and support individuals that have similar opinions to ours. It's not surprising then that Trump supporters tended to interact with messages from pro-Trump twitter bots. These in turn were spread to other Trump supporters and so on. 

The most relevant centrality measures to this example would be degree centrality (number of raw connections a twitter user has) and eigenvector centrality (how connected the twitter user is to other well-connected nodes). Both of these metrics would allow us to see what exposure the bots have to the twitterverse. The number of raw connections would be the base population for the initial tweet, but the eigenvector centrality would tell us how expansive the overall exposure of the tweets would be. 

In this particular case, the centrality metrics would help us to analyze the extent of the spread of information throughout the network. The higher the degree and eigenvector centrality, the further the information can traverse through the network. Although these centrality measures can tell us the potential of exposure, it doesn't tell us much about the likelihood of spread. In order to make a more accurate prediction, we would want to incorporate the user activity for each account. The more active a user base, the more likely the tweet will be interacted with and relayed. Thus, centrality metrics should be combined with additional user attributes to make a better prediction. 

"
Russian Twitter Bots,2,Vijaya Cherukuri,Amber Ferger,Good example Amber. Fake news is spreading its wings and became a big issue now a days. In elections it played a crucial role and changed the face of parties.
Russian Twitter Bots,2,Subhalaxmi Rout,Amber Ferger,"Nice explanation Amber, these days difficult to identify real and fake news. due to social media sources, people get influenced more by fake news and fake news spread quickly. Using social network analysis we can find out fake news sources. "
Kane Gamble vs CIA,1,Vijaya Cherukuri,Vijaya Cherukuri,"Kane Gamble successfully used social engineering to get into the email accounts of CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, amongst others. This gave him access to highly sensitive military documents and intelligence operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

His method was simple but efficient, leading him to change security questions and numbers and gain access to many other accounts. He also managed to set up an auto-forward service directing phone calls from Clapper’s home to the Free Palestine Movement."
Kane Gamble vs CIA,1,Vijaya Cherukuri,Vijaya Cherukuri,"One more example i can think of it  Associated Press’ (AP) Twitter account posted a fake tweet stating, “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured” to it’s more than 2 million followers."
Different Centrality Measures,1,Jit Seneviratne,Jit Seneviratne,"Degree centrality is useful to determine the reach a person or entity has. A Youtube influencer is an example of high degree centrality. Closeness centrality is useful to find out how close someone is to another person. Unlike degree centrality, closeness centrality is based on the shortest paths across all nodes. This concept is useful on a platform such as Linked In, where relationships are ranked according to degrees (1st, 2nd or 3rd, not a graph theory concept). Another concept similar to closeness centrality is betweenness centrality. Betweenness centrality looks at the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path across two other nodes. This concept might be critical in power grid setups, where distance is of interest to minimize cost.

As a whole, centrality measures are used in a wide variety of industries. Intelligence agencies use these to understand key players in clandestine networks and neutralize threats. Citibike probably does frequent network analyses of their bike docks, to optimize distribution."
Different Centrality Measures,2,Priya Shaji,Jit Seneviratne,Nice information about difference between centrality measures. Use of these in Intelligence agencies is a good use case for  SNA.
centrality measures as indicators of leadership,1,Priya Shaji,Priya Shaji,"The findings here suggest that degree centrality helps as an indicator of local opinion leadership, since a high degree centrality means many connections in the direct environment of a vertex. 


To assess global opinion leadership, the closeness and betweenness centrality measures are better suited. Individuals who are easily reachable by others have a higher chance of being noticed (closeness centrality), while individuals who lie on communication paths can exert a greater influence on that communication.

centrality measures as indicators of leadership,2,Elina Azrilyan ,Priya Shaji,Thank you for sharing this link - a lot of in-depth information about Degree Centrality which really helped me understand the concept!
centrality measures as indicators of leadership,2,Jit Seneviratne,Priya Shaji,"Reminds me of network analyses involving emails. If a CEO has high closeness centrality where nodes include all employees irrespective of title, it shows that the CEO is reachable (which is a good thing I suppose)."
Elon Musk,1,Elina Azrilyan ,Elina Azrilyan ,"Elon Musk is an example of effective social network personality and he is in the center of the public’s eye at the moment. He is considered to be a “visionary” by many due to his Tesla and SpaceX achievements. Elon Musk is the influencer who built and continues to use his personal brand in connection with the company’s brand. It is pretty unusual for a CEO to take that role and can have some negative consequences when controversial issues are discussed on his platform, such as his public announcement against government’s stay-at-home order during the pandemic.

Eigenvector centrality will be a useful metric in measuring Elon Musk’s influence. Eigenvector centrality which assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. Centrality measures are very useful in determining the extend of his influence and measuring the consequences of the messages he shares. We could measure the impact of his communications on Tesla sales or people refusing to follow stay-at-home orders."
Gayle King,1,Sheryl Piechocki,Sheryl Piechocki,"When I think of someone who hacked their network, I think of Gayle King.  The only reason anyone ever heard of Gayle King was because she is Oprah's best friend.  She was Oprah's best friend before Oprah became famous.  As Oprah rose to fame, she often mentioned Gayle, had her on her show, etc.  This is how Gayle King then became famous.  In the beginning she was a very close network connection to Oprah, a person with high degree centrality.  Through that relationship she was able to increase her own degree centrality.  "
Cambridge Analytica,1,Subhalaxmi Rout,Subhalaxmi Rout,"Cambridge Analytica is an example of hacking/navigating to social networks. Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to harvest data, primarily psychographic, in order to target and persuade swathes of people. They collected as much as data they could from Facebook login, they created an app which gathered psychometric data from the user’s personality quiz. Like this, they created an exponentially large feature-rich dataset representing psychological profiles for almost 100 Million people. Then they used complex machine learning to ‘fill out’ these psychological profiles and build up a model to target these individuals with highly personalized advertising; to optimize persuasion and conversion rates. This model was infamously used during the 2016 Presidential Election and the Brexit vote.
For Cambridge Analytica, Degree centrality and eigenvector centrality measures are more relevant.

My Most Recent Job Search,1,Ken Popkin,Ken Popkin,"It's a statement we all hear over and over that goes something like this, ""xx% of all job offers come from networking, not from just submitting your resume to job sights"".   But I wasn't heeding the advice even though I knew I needed to...

I was ten days into my Covid-19 furlough, my employer's revenue was down over 50%, and I knew it would be months (if ever) to call me back.  I was submitting resumes to job sites, even though I secretly knew that it was about the same as chewing a Certs candy instead of taking an aspirin to get rid of a headache.

But, then I saw a job posting for ""Principal Project Manager - Data Science"" from my former employer.  Having been a project manager in IT for years and pursuing my passion for Data Science the past two years, this job posting described me perfectly.  Here's what happened next...

1. On a Thursday evening I submitted my resume to HR and emailed a friend (George) still at my former employer.  He replied back with the hiring manager's name (which is listed on the internal posting, but not the external one).

2. On Friday, I sent an email to the hiring manager (Steve), explaining how I got his name, my passion for Data Science, and that I was a former employee.

3. On Monday morning, Steve replied back and we arranged a phone call for Wednesday morning.

4. Several interviews and three weeks later, I had an offer, which I gladly accepted.

5. I just finished my third week at my new employer and things are going great.

Social networking works, even though introverted types like me often try to convince ourselves that it doesn't. I do admire (and at times envy) you extroverts that more easily accomplish all the social networking both online and in real life."
My Most Recent Job Search,2,Sheryl Piechocki,Ken Popkin,"Thanks for sharing your story Ken.  I am reminded of the saying:  its not what you know, its who you know.

I, too, consider myself an introvert, and can relate.  It is not in an introverts nature to develop a large social network and this can work against us, especially in a job search.  "
My Most Recent Job Search,2,Murat Akyildirim,Ken Popkin,I am on the same boat here. Definitely an introvert. But i still dont understand how being connected with someone with little to no strength can bring any value in job search. 
My Most Recent Job Search,2,Jit Seneviratne,Ken Popkin,Congrats on the new job. It would be interesting to see what my LinkedIn network looks like. I'm sure it'll yield a few influential individuals who can help me with my next job :)
My Most Recent Job Search,2,Mikhail Kollontai,Ken Popkin,"My 3 last jobs were all results of either a former colleague or former manager contacting me about a position. Though I haven't been out of college all that long (8 years), only my first job wasn't a direct result of networking - though even that one was through a recruiter. 

As a fellow introvert I feel like this does make us feel a little less confident in our prospects in the job market, so I'm happy to hear your turnaround time was relatively low. 

I myself am starting to look for jobs because my wife an I are planning to move to Detroit in October, but I have no contacts there and I'm attempting a shift from engineering into Data Science, so I'm extremely reliant on the hiring websites. Expecting this to be a very painful process.  "
My Most Recent Job Search,2,Willie Smalls,Ken Popkin,"Congrats, Ken!  You made it very easy for them!  They probably already knew the quality of your work (since you worked there) and you had someone internal to vouch for you.  "
My Most Recent Job Search,2,Jagdish Chhabria,Ken Popkin,I completely agree Ken. Most job searches seem to be influenced heavily by social networking - essentially through multiple loose ties with a host of people (nodes) as opposed to a few strong ties with just a handful of people. I am seeing that play out in real time.
Facebook Groups in Colleges,1,Murat Akyildirim,Murat Akyildirim,"College Students – Social Network sites are important for students specially in the beginning years. These networks will allow them to build their networks in and out of the campus. In the process, the most important variable that can be measured is centrality. In this case, How many first year students has connected to the social network (whatever this network may be, school network, fb , linkedin group and etc…) Degree of centrality would be the number students connection with other students.

Students can be connected to the multiple different networks. This will allow them to keep the cost of maintaining their relationship with others. If students message continuously through these social networks, it will allow them to maintain their relationships.

 

Below link is a pdf that has a sample study on Social Networks with student participation.

1-      Selected students become a part of a Facebook group based on the study.

2-      They are asked to answer some questions and friend FB account so the researchers can track their social network.

3-      They become fb friends within each other through the research.

4-      Network data is collected every first of the month for 9 months.

The study measured;

1-      FB usage

2-      Find out how students maintain their communication (what kind of strategy they use)

3-      General Behaviors within Facebook

4-      Visual Representation of the networks are defined.

5-      Centrality, degree of centrality and betweenness is measured.

"Steve Jobs, Trump … and the divide",1,Simon Ustoyev,Simon Ustoyev,"disclaimer: I’ll try to stick to data science here and avoid politics. :)


In my attempt to come up with a different example of a person who was effective and influential to his or her social network, two names from the modern times, such as Steve Jobs and Trump can readily come to not just my mind, but I’m sure to lots of you as well.  So, what kind of metrics or network attributes can explain their impact in social and traditional media?  One attribute, in my opinion, is the position that such individuals step into, such as CEO, POTUS or any other similar position of power and influence, which inherently carry a high degree metric of followers.  Another attribute is that it matters who the person is.  For example, it matters if a message is from Steve Jobs vs. Tim Cook or from Trump (vs. or I don’t know…) vs. anybody else.  I couldn’t associate this personality factor to any metric from Paul Revere’s analysis article.  But perhaps there is another metric that should be identified which can quantify the amount of “charge” (“electricity” if you will) or potential that is formed in the network around such personalities and in response to the messages they propagate through such “supper-charged” networks.  In the case of Paul Revere, there was a “highly important” alert that invoked a unified response against impending British invasion.  However, for Steve Jobs and Trump, the network around them can be categorized as divided or highly polarized (there are “never-iPhone or iAnything” camp against Steve Jobs and “never-Trumpers” against Trump).  Such high degree of passions pro and against, create some degree of “charge” in the network with both polarized camps being highly in tune to every message coming from these individuals.  Such network, although polarized or divided, becomes “supper conductive” and therefore have vast outreach, as the messages reach and then propagated more effectively by the “opinionated” connectors (“salesmen/saleswomen”) in the network.  Maybe that’s why Trump’s tweets spread like wild fire."
Footballer's influence in sports gear,1,Habib Khan,Habib Khan,"There are bunch of footballers such as Messi, Christiano Ronaldo who heavily influences the audience significantly that's why brands such as Adidas, Nike, etc have made these footballers as their brand ambassadors to change the perception of general public towards their brand. Now if you think of playing sports or hitting gym, you want to put on these clothing brands that already had influenced us. Lionel Messi has 2.9 million followers on twitter that's why Adidas has life time deals with him and bunch of other athletes. These companies know how footballers can influence people and change people's perception towards these brands."
Musical Artists,1,Willie Smalls,Willie Smalls,"Many artists often do collaborations with other artists to increase the degree of centrality.  Frequently we see pop stars feature with hip hop and R&B stars to popularize a particular song, increase the rank of the song on the billboard 100 charts or expose one artist or both to a new genre or country.  One person who capitalizes on features to increase her popularity or the popularity of a song is Nicki Minaj.  While Nicki Minaj is a bona fide hip hop artist, she has used features to score number ones on the Latin, Pop, R&B, Hip-hop, Reggae, Dance, Electronic, and Gospel charts.  These crossovers have benefited her and other artists, exposing each's fans to new genres.  I am sure that there are numerous analysts in the back crunching numbers trying to figure out which artists should feature with with other artist to increase sales or score a no. 1 single. "
MLM,1,Steven Ellingson,Steven Ellingson,"We've all seen these pop up in our facebook feeds, or in conversations with family members, etc.  Multi-Level Marketing schemes.  It used to be vacuums and tupperware, now it's yoga pants, essential oils, and health patches. 


Most companies have to work very hard to build trust in their brand.  These companies hack social networks to appropriate the trust that family and friends have with each other. I don't trust that some random health shake company has my best interests in mind, but what if it's my sister who's selling the product?  This is something she swears by, and she is telling me that X product is life-changing. All of the hard steps to selling a product (getting an audience, gaining rapport, etc.) are already done. The rest is easy."
Boundary spanners and crossovers,1,Jagdish Chhabria,Jagdish Chhabria,"When I think of people navigating social networks well, the examples that I find interesting are those of crossovers - people who had extensive connections in their chosen field, who then decided to parley their very high levels of degree centrality to enter another network where they got a lot of connections as a virtue of their role in the previous network. The examples that I can think of are people like Marc Andreesen who was responsible for creating the first (or maybe second) Internet Browser called Netscape Navigator. He then went on to become a successful venture capitalist in a firm called Andreesen Horowitz.

Other interesting examples are couples who had very high degree centrality in two different fields (large network of fans) who then gained credibility or connections in another field (or social network) by virtue of establishing a relationship (with very high weightage) with this other person (or node). Examples: David Beckham (sports network) and Posh Spice (pop music network), Prince Harry (British royalty) and Meghan Markle (American films). One can think of these power couples as boundary spanners i.e. they enjoy a prominent place in 2 different networks by virtue of this one really strong edge."
"Apple ""trust scores""",1,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,"Apple is quietly giving people 'trust scores' based on their iPhone data

Auto Insurance Fraud,1,Ken Popkin,Ken Popkin,"Professional fraud in auto insurance has been a problem for decades and probably will never cease being a problem.  Fortunately machine learning and specifically social network analysis has become a significant contributor to identifying potential fraud. 

According to research from the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering there are,"" new approaches for identification, representation, and analysis of organized fraudulent groups in automobile insurance through focusing on structural aspects of networks, and cycles in particular, that demonstrate the occurrence of potential fraud.""

On page 3, the article mentions, "" The detection of suspicious components starts in this expert system after creation of a network. Afterward, the system determines the suspicious entities in each of the detected suspicious components by displaying the social network of these entities. Unlike other solutions, this system uses network and graph to display data... the researchers have provided an algorithm called Iterative Assessment Algorithm (IAA) to identify the fraud entities. Along with the original and inherent characteristics of entities, this algorithm explores the relationships between entities.""

On page 6, there is mention of a ""DFS algorithm"" that  establishes the local social network location of each entity (node) in order to overcome posed issues by unbalanced data sets.

In total, the article mentions social networking 18 times and the references to algorithms I have yet to learn about is eye opening to the power and capability of social network analysis.  For now, I'll stick with the centrality measures that we've learned to date, but I can definitely see the great potential that social networking could contribute to the reduction of fraud in auto insurance."
Auto Insurance Fraud,2,Sheryl Piechocki,Ken Popkin,This is very interesting.  I didn't know there was an issue with fraud in auto insurance.  Groups of individuals scheming and setting up fake accidents in order to make insurance claims is something I never heard of before.  Scheming individuals are very keen.  I like this use of cycles to identify them.  The likelihood of these cycles being quite low is a good measure for detecting the fraud.

Link analysis in investigations,1,Priya Shaji,Priya Shaji,"Criminal investigations worldwide face a monumental big data problem that is escalating in the digital age. Today’s data is massive, complex, continuously changing and varied. The reality is that many investigators have become overwhelmed with information, and identifying connections in data is often a difficult and time-consuming task.


Link analysis can be used to evaluate relationships and connections among people, organizations and transactions. It can be a powerful tool to identify patterns and trends and drastically reduce the time and effort required to expose patterns indicative of fraud, money laundering and a host of other criminal activities.

Issues with link analysis:

Information overload: With the vast amounts of data and information that are stored electronically, users are confronted with multiple unrelated sources of information available for analysis.Data itself has inherent issues including integrity (or lack of) and continuous changes. Data may contain “errors of omission and commission because of faulty collection or handling, and when entities are actively attempting to deceive and/or conceal their actions”.

These may contribute to increase of error rates. There are few proposed solutions to overcome these here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_analysis

Link analysis in investigations,2,Elina Azrilyan ,Priya Shaji,"Priya, I think you make a great point - the more data there is - the more difficult it becomes to investigate and identify connections. Thank you for sharing the resources with more information on Link Analysis, it it very interesting. "
Link analysis in investigations,2,Zachary Alexander,Priya Shaji,"Hi Priya,

Very much enjoyed your post -- I definitely agree that criminal investigations are prone to carry large and complex networks, many times very difficult to parse through. I thought the lecture video was quite interesting, when Veronique touched on how they measured fraud scores based on proximity to already fraudulent nodes, something that could be done for criminal investigations but could hold catastrophic consequences if not executed correctly (wrongly identifying individuals that are actually innocent while simultaneously classifying individuals as innocent when they are actually guilty). Thanks too for providing the error rate information on link analysis -- very helpful!

Credit card fraud detection,1,Subhalaxmi Rout,Subhalaxmi Rout,"Frauds are everywhere — wherever a transaction is involved— but credit card fraud is probably the most known case. Credit card frauds have always existed but the magnitude is only growing recently due to increasing online transactions taking place through credit cards every day. 

How to detect fraud by the bank?
Purchase transactions on the Internet are handled in credit card networks through an authorization process. Tools are in place which allows a typical behavior to be flagged and alerts to be raised so that the issuer bank can check with the cardholder whether the transaction is valid or not. If not, the card will be blocked (so that no further transaction can be made with it) and a fraud declaration will be filed for the next investigation (by the bank and the police). Usually, the first case of fraud on a card is not detected, only the second or the third … Of course, early detection will reduce the cost of fraud.

Below are the techniques apply to resolve frauds:

predictive mode
exploratory mode
Fraud detection performance is measure through two indicators i.e Coverage and Relevance. 

Coverage: Rate of fraud cases detected by the systems

Relevance: It is the rate of correct detection, i.e. the ratio of alerts which are real cases of fraud. Coverage = TP/(TP+FN)Relevance=TP/(TP+FP)

Where TP = True Positive, FP = False Positive, TN = True Negative, FN = False Negative.

Credit card fraud detection,2,Jack Russo,Subhalaxmi Rout,"You beat me to this one. You didn't mention any network characteristics, like similar transactions between fraudulent purchases. "
Credit card fraud detection,2,Subhalaxmi Rout,Jack Russo,"Thank you for mentioning that point, Jack. 

Detecting unauthorized credit card transactions is an extremely complex problem but there is some hidden pattern in the fraudulent activity such as unusual purchasing situation (card being used to make purchase different place at the same time), purchase from unusual store (i.e., a store never visited before by the card owner, located in a different city), etc. "
Credit card fraud detection,2,Abdellah Ait Elmouden,Subhalaxmi Rout,"Applying social network analysis for detection does come with some limitations . SNA is retrospective in nature, we can only react to a fraudulent instance after it has occurred.  Unlike other data analytics tools and techniques, social network analysis is not a modelling technique."
Credit card fraud detection,2,Steven Ellingson,Subhalaxmi Rout,"I'm not sure I agree with this.  SNA itself isn't a predictive model, but can't it be used in a predictive model?  Couldn't you take measures from your SNA and add them as predictors in a regression model? If you have historical information on the SN for past customers, I don't know why you couldn't use it for predictive analysis going forward."
Tax fraud,1,Jack Russo,Jack Russo,"As pointed out by Ms.Vlasselaer, 

Any shared reasource between two nodes can be evidence of fraud. In the presented case of fraudulent companies, shared assets, addresses, phone numbers could be used to weight the edges of each edge. Using this method the Belgan SSA was able to detect new fraudulent companies within 1 percent presicion. A similar approach could be applied to tax returns here in the United States. Shared Addresses, phone numbers, and places of work with fraudulent returns could be used to construct a graph with weighted edges. A precision rate  in this use case may or may not be comparable given that 250K companies is far less than 300 million potential tax returns."
Tax fraud,2,Amber Ferger,Jack Russo,"This is a really great point to make and is true of many different types of fraud -- individuals connected to confirmed fraudulent nodes tend to also be fraudulent. We see this in the case of health insurance fraud as well, especially in cases where a provider creates new aliases to bill under. Visualizing the connections between parties can be so useful in detecting fraud early on!"
Provider Fraud,1,Amber Ferger,Amber Ferger,"Most health insurance companies have an entire department dedicated to identifying fraud, waste, and abuse in provider billing. While waste and abuse tend to be easier to identify and correct, fraud is much more complex because it is (1) constantly evolving, (2) hidden within the data, and (3) a lot less obvious. Our Special Investigations Unit utilizes software that combines data from a variety of public data sources and allows the investigators to visualize the provider networks and more easily identify connections within the communities. The network is multi-modal: it includes different types of nodes (physicians, offices, relatives, facilities) and different types of edges (familial relationships, business partnerships, affiliations, contact). The incorporation of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and foreclosures makes the software a very powerful and informative tool for visualizing a suspected provider's fraudulent activity.

With respect to the network attributes we've been discussing in class, there are a few that I can think of that are directly applicable to these types of networks:

Fraudulent providers can have a low degree centrality - in this type of fraudulent behavior, the individual operates independently of the other providers in the network. In a typical provider network, there is high connectivity, so this metric is indicative of potentially suspicious activity.
Fraudulent providers can have high betweenness - in this type of fraudulent behavior, the provider serves as the boundary spanner between the densely-connected network core and nodes with very few (or no) other connections. The betweenness metric can help to identify providers that are operating under fake aliases in order to gain more revenue. 
Fraudulent providers can have open triads - in this type of fraudulent behavior, a provider has relationships with other providers that do not have relationships with each other. This ensures that the fraudulent provider controls the information that is passed from one node to the other. 
Fraudulent providers can form their own cliques - in this type of fraudulent behavior, many providers are in on the same ""scheme"" and tend to be clustered together. If a provider is found to be fraudulent, it is a good idea to look at the other providers that are within that cluster.
Since fraudulent providers are such a small portion of the entire provider network, creating an algorithm that is 99% accurate may actually classify all providers in the network as non-fraudulent. Because we are interested in identifying the providers that are actually fraudulent (positive cases), we should measure the accuracy of the model in terms of the true positive rate (sensitivity). Sensitivity, or recall, is the proportion of true fraudulent cases that are actually detected. A high sensitivity means that we detect a large number of the providers that are fraudulent. "
Provider Fraud,2,Vijaya Cherukuri,Amber Ferger,"Very nice information Amber. With enhanced provider network we can have high chances to identify the fraud.
Similarly from the front end, by using big data and better network model we can reduce many frauds."
Provider Fraud,2,Jagdish Chhabria,Amber Ferger,"Hi Amber - is it just medical providers who perpetrate this fraud or does the network include patients as well? My understanding is that if a particular set of patients show unusual and repeated visits to medical facilities, they would end up seeing increased medical premiums, isn't it? So how exactly does fraud against health-care companies work? And don't the medical facilities or providers involved in this, risk losing their license to practice medicine? Given that medical providers typically make higher than average income, I wonder how high is the payoff from fraud to make this attractive to someone like that?"
Detecting Corruption,1,Murat Akyildirim,Murat Akyildirim,"Similar to Fraud Detection example we can use network analytics to detect corruption such as insider trading or cash payments for favorable actions for other companies and bribery within organizations. “Which person will commit to corruption based on the supplier (or companies or individuals or resources) they work with?”

People commit corruption because they know other people who have done the same. Challenges are the same as the fraud example; uncommon (number of corrupted activities are smaller), well considered (recent data is more important), imperceptibly concealed (expert level input might be required -investigators, detectives or someone with similar past), time evaluating (something that is considered as corrupt and not ethical may not be considered the same tomorrow – for example, I heard real estate broker’s had something called finder’s fee in the past which would allow them to give preference on the buyer with a certain fee in the past which is now illegal) , carefully organized (example: organized crime family)

We can use bipartile graph 2 nodes where one node represent the people and the other represents the suppliers (or resources) they work with. Transactional data we can use are the phone calls between the suppliers and people and between everyone’s, bank data (wire transfers and etc…) and text messages between everyone.

Nodes <- individuals

Black nodes <- corrupted individuals (maybe individuals that committed corruption in the past)

Triangle nodes <-suppliers

Triangle black nodes <- corrupted suppliers

Similar to the example, we also want homophily , where people tend to connect to other people with similar interest and goals. Which leads to the corrupt individuals would most likely be connected to each other. We want homophily for model accuracy.

In terms of feature extraction, we can look at the degree (how many corrupted individuals connected to each other)

The network model that we would create would be better than a model that does not include the network in terms of predicting corrupted activity as it would distinguish the bribery or other corrupted behavior better. We look at accuracy, precision and recall. Precision with network model would be better in terms of giving us the potential corrupted individuals. Network model would also detect more corrupted individuals compare to non network model"
Detecting Corruption,2,Mikhail Kollontai,Murat Akyildirim,"Murat, this is a fascinating take on corruption that reminds me a little of the stereotypical cork boards with red string used in investigations on TV. Find the individuals and track their networks. In addition to the number of corrupt individuals connected to each other, having information of the extent of their interactions would provide a potential ""weight"" to the edges, helping track individuals who have a more than normal amount of contact with the corrupt, perhaps assisting in identifying new players. "
Insider Threats,1,Mikhail Kollontai,Mikhail Kollontai,"Monitoring internal network interactions can help a firm identify potential insider threats. There are certain types of behavior and trends associated with network access activity, time logging, etc. that can help identify high risk individuals automatically. Each account within a network can be considered a node as can every network device. With time each employee will have a regular network of machines they interact with. Sudden changes within the edges between the user node and the machine nodes (especially a large number of new edges leading to previously unused machines) can be an early indicator of malicious activity. There is software available that will track the network connections within an organization and automatically flag such outliers for deeper analysis.

Insider Threats,2,Subhalaxmi Rout,Mikhail Kollontai,"Great post, Misha, insider threats make trouble to the organization. Companies applied some measures to identify the treat such as user credential being used from different locations, different devices to connect (user never log in to that device), login attempt to multiple devices, etc. Using “network traffic analytics” companies can monitor and identify that device that has been infected."
Insider Threats,2,Mael Illien,Mikhail Kollontai,"That's interesting. While it makes sense, I didn't think the proportionality of negligent employees would be so high in insider breachers. It now makes a lot of sense why my company's IT is always testing us with phishing attacks."
Russian Twitter Troll Detection,1,Mael Illien,Mael Illien,"Here is a great example of social network analysis involving the interference of Russian twitter trolls in the 2016 US election. A Neo4j analysis was performed to identify the troll networks as reported in the NCB News article sourced below below. You can see the twitter trolls in action by examining the dataset provided which contains sample tweets from 10 influential twitter trolls. The Neo4j case study explains how they studied relationships between username, tweet content, hashtags and links. By using centrality measure like pagerank and community detection algorithms the researchers were able to find who were the primary influencer trolls, and who were the retweeters that amplify the message. Using the temporal aspects of the the dataset, they were also able to identify that troll tweets were mostly posted by computers instead of a mobile device, and that tweet spikes occurred during the working hours in Russia.

Out of the different types of troll account, some of the usernames were chosen to resemble typical Americans such as @LeroyLovesUSA. Others mimicked news sites such as @ OnlineCleveland. A third category pretended to be political organizations such as @TEN_GOP, which represented itself at the Tennessee Republican Party.

In looking at the error rate, I think it is easier to correctly identify the influencers, based on the patterns discussed above. However, I imagine the error rate would be higher when detecting amplifier trolls because it is possible that false positive users are simply retweeting the original troll without being a participant in the troll network. A lot of the propagation strategy has to do with normal users diffusing the tweet containing the misinformation to their own ego networks.

Association Health Plans,1,Sheryl Piechocki,Sheryl Piechocki,"Association health insurance plans are health insurance plans for individuals that are part of some professional group.  By banding together in the association, the individuals who are not otherwise eligible for a company insurance plan, can get cheaper premiums and better benefits than buying individual health insurance.  Examples include: professional associations for self-employed individuals like plumbers or electricians, and freelancers.   

Fraudulent associations have been discovered by insurance companies.  In these cases, members of the association are not part of any professional group, but rather are extended family groups or social groups.  Social network analysis could be used to identify these fraudulent associations.  Members that are included in a health care association form a network, this network could be compared to other public social networks (FB, Twitter, etc.) to determine if there is overlap in the networks and how much overlap.  A suspected fraudulent association could then be analyzed further, comparing addresses of individuals, and known family relationships.  "
Association Health Plans,2,Jit Seneviratne,Sheryl Piechocki,"I wonder if insurance companies can avoid these networks forming altogether by allowing groups (maybe 20 to 50 people) get a community plan. I know it sounds a bit far-fetched, but why not? Anyway, this is a good example of using network analysis to identify questionable clusters.

"
Tax Evasion Fraud,1,Elina Azrilyan ,Elina Azrilyan ,"The presentation in the video lecture makes a very good point about considering Fraud as part of a Social Network - it is likely that people who commit fraud are telling their friends and business connections about it and there could be a benefit in considering that in Fraud detection efforts. This could be utilized when identifying tax evasion fraud - if there is a node on the network that an individual committing fraud uses as a “write-off” (charity or an employee) - an investigation of all other nodes (tax-payers) linked to this entity would need to be suspected of fraud as well. We could use centrality measures to identify the node that might be driving this fraud on the Network and thus further improve detection by focusing on their direct connections. Maybe there is a common geography, business partnership or tax preparer. Corporate tax evasion might be detected for companies based on shared resources such as infrastructure, employees or equipment. "
Insurance Fraud Detection,1,Vanita Thompson,Vanita Thompson,"Social networks help insurance agencies connect with their customers for branding and marketing purposes. In addition, insurance companies use acquired data for fraund detection. Social Network Analysis allows insurers to proactively look through large amounts of data to show the reltionships of links and nodes. Having the ability to collect this data gives an insight to the parameters involved in an insurance fraud case. The Social Network Analysis Approach includes organizational business rules, statistical methods, pattern analysis, and network linkage analysis. When looking for fraud, SNA uses cluster analysis, like linkage analysis to rate claims. Public records like judgements, foreclosures, criminal record, and address change frequency can all be used for rating. A high rating, indicates fraud. Technologies such as text mining, clustering, sentiment analysis and content categorization are used in SNA to build predictive models.

Network Analysis - Organized Crime,1,Zachary Alexander,Zachary Alexander,"As mentioned in the lecture by Veronique Vlasselaer, network analysis can be used in myriad fields. One field in particular that I found is incorporating network analysis is via law enforcement and organized crime. Similar to Veronique's example of working with unipartite and bipartite graphs, measuring connections as well as resources, this is also true for organized crime networks. A paper published by Anine Kriegler, from the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) titled, ""Using social network analysis to profile organised crime"" documents the social network analysis conducted on a massive and complex South African arms deal in the late 1990s, which raised allegations of corruption resulting in numerous criminal cases.

By attaching different types of relationships to edges, the ISS team was able to graph out the extensive network of contractors, senior-level officials, and shareholders throughout the ordeal. Similar to the lecture's tactic, the ISS team categorized, and then isolated the types of relationships, measuring which relationship types were most common in terms of facilitating the potentially corrupt transfer of resources. This tactic has proven to be very insightful, and could be developed further for more recent corruption analysis and to better inform how these types of exchanges of resources and bribery tactics play out in a larger social network. The paper does also go into detail about the centrality measures that were measured, but is quick to warn that many of these centrality measures are limited based on the number of connections between nodes, and doesn't touch on the weights of edges. If this type of analysis were to be utilized in the future, considerations of the level of severity of corrupt exchanges would need to be better formalized (in order for officials tracking the network to triage the most corrupt players), as well as making sure that there was a good handle on the temporal aspect of nodes moving in and out of the network -- the ISS team acknowledged that this was lacking from their analysis of the famous arms deal.

An ""error rate"" may be quite high if this type of network were adapted to a current illicit organized crime network. Without these factors established (i.e. temporal players, edge weights based on severity of resource exchanges, etc.), it could potentially lead to false positive predictions of individuals that ""will become corrupt"", (but actually don't) while simultaneously flag false negative predictions of individuals ""that will not become corrupt"" (but actually do)."
Physical Risk to Patients,1,Vijaya Cherukuri,Vijaya Cherukuri,"Shockingly, the perpetrators of some types of health care fraud schemes deliberately and callously place trusting patients at significant risk of injury or even death. It's distressing to imagine, but there have been many cases where patients have been subjected to unnecessary or dangerous medical procedures simply because of greed. Unnecessary procedures can result in countless irreversible outcomes such as patients losing their ability to have children or losing full physical mobility.

In health care there is a seperate depatments called Utilization management and Fraud, waste and abuse them that uses natural language processing and many algorithms to identy the fraud cases and also determine where fraud schemes are followed by few practitioners/providers.
In fact, Medicare conducts reviews on less than three percent of medical claims before sending out checks.

How network analysis can help reduce the fraud.

1) More reviews on medicare claims while processing.

2) Stopping Fraud on the Front-endUsing big data and what’s called “social network analytics,” healthcare agencies can now reverse the traditional investigative process. Rather than starting with one suspect individual and then building out the network of contacts and business relationships, the new process begins with data. Lots of data — as much as 50 terabytes.

3) In Providers, if we can conduct a degree of centrality, and advanced algorithm to find the fraud providers.

Fraud detection in banking sector,1,Habib Khan,Habib Khan,"Social network analysis is one of the emergent data mining methods in fraud analytics which comes out pretty useful to identify irregular payment transactions to avoid any loss to the bank and customer both. In fraud detection, the interactions can be viewed as heterogeneous networks with multiple participants. Usually, number of participants are huge. Graph analysis techniques can be used further to identify suspicious individuals, groups, relationships, unusual change over time or geography. Some of popular network analytics are following:

1- Network visualization and eg-centric canalysis

2- Graph walking to identify rings

3- Centrality measures

4- Snowball method

5- Network topologies

There are lot of challenges for fraud detection which can be helpful to improve the accuracy of fraud detection. Lack of automation in network analytics in fraud detection and the need for expert analysis and interpretations are needed to improve the error. Data analysts should have a good knowledge of domain which would be very helpful for effective network analysis.

Fraud detection in banking sector,2,Simon Ustoyev,Habib Khan,"I suppose in banking, the success of fraud detection is centered around KYC (know-your-customer) in order to establish the patterns of legitimate transactions and behavior for a given client.  SNA would then be well suited to find outliers or unusual behavior and also to detect if anything is connecting to already known or highly suspected fraudulent nodes.  I agree that a good knowledge of domain is required here."
Enron and SPEs,1,Jit Seneviratne,Jit Seneviratne,"We briefly discussed Enron last week, and I remembered how Enron used Special Purpose Entities (SPEs). One way it used SPEs whas to consolidate assets of the SPEs and not the liabilities. I wonder if there is a network structure that can identify unusual SPE's where edges are asset/liabilities owed to and expected from the parent entity. Just a thought!"
Distinguishing Manipulated Stocks,1,Simon Ustoyev,Simon Ustoyev,"Here's a link to a study which attempted to distinguish manipulated stocks from non-manipulated, by analyzing trading behavior using network analysis.

http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~shenhuawei/publications/2011/pa-sun.pdf

Below is an extract from the conclusion of the study:

""...By comparing the degree and strength distributions between non-manipulated stocks and manipulated stocks, we find that manipulated stocks have a higher lower bound of the power-law tail, and higher average degree of the trading network than non-manipulated ones. By analyzing the correlation between the price return and seller–buyer ratio, we find that manipulated stocks have a lower correlation than non-manipulated stocks.""

 

It could be a challenge to interpret and understand the study.  If you're wondering what power-law is, I found this link helpful: 

https://www.statisticshowto.com/power-law/

 

I could be wrong in my interpretation, but here's how I understood the conclusion of the study in more lame terms.

With manipulated stocks one can observe more aggressive trading done with more investors (i.e. trading counterparts).  Intuitively this makes sense because in order to capitalize on a stock manipulation, you would increase trading activity and enlarge the pool of market participants.

 

Below is a link to another interesting market manipulation scandal (on LIBOR rate), which one can think about how useful SNA could've been in detecting it.

Fraud detection in online lending,1,Steven Ellingson,Steven Ellingson,"With online lending, fraud is rampant and is something that is constantly being combatted with. 

One piece of data that could be attempted to validate with social network analysis is The employer.


We could look at a bipartite social network to determine the likelihood that this person works where they say they do. How many connections do they have with other people in that field, in that specific employer?

Error rates are tough for this type of thing.  You are looking for something that doesn't happen often, so if your model ALWAYS said that there was no fraud involved, the error rate would actually look pretty good.  You would never deny only customers who are more than 50% likely to be fraudulent, you need to have a probability to determine the level of risk you are ok with. If the model makes your overall fraud model more accurate, then it is worth pursuing.  The difference between a 1% fraud rate and a 1.1% fraud rate could have a huge effect on the profitability of a company."
Using network analytics to detect money laundering,1,Jagdish Chhabria,Jagdish Chhabria,"I came across an interesting article published by Mckinsey & Co. that discusses the use of network analytics to detect money laundering. The underlying use case has the same properties as others where SNA is used - compared to the total number of money transfers, the proportion of those used for money laundering is very low. Having said that, the article suggests using relationships between different types of nodes - 1) individual account holders or business entities and 2) accounts, the attributes of these nodes such as location and the depositary institution, and finally the attributes of the transfers (edges) such as direction, frequency and amounts, as a way to detect money laundering.
