Google Ads,1,Vanita Thompson,Vanita Thompson,"Google Ads provides analytic reporting on how people use a website. Google Analytics tracks what people do after clicking an ad. It traces and provides information on how people found a particular website, and how the website was explored.  Using the information, a website owner can identify trends and generate ideas to enhance their website. For example, you can learn how much time is spent on a site, what items were browsed, and what items were placed in the cart. Those factors can provide leads on enhancing customers' experience, which in turn can help increase conversions like sales and return on ad spend."
Google Ads,2,Zachary Alexander,Vanita Thompson,"Hi Vanita -- I definitely agree that Google Ads provides a really good platform for analytical reporting and marketing. I used to work pretty closely with Google's suite of marketing tools and think they are really advanced in their ability to measure advertisement/marketing reach, as well as user and website activity! Google Analytics has continued to a leader on this front, and I'm curious to see if we talk much about this in our course!"
